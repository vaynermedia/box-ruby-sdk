    # @param [Hash] criteria The hash of criteria to use. Each key of
    #        the criteria will be called on each sub-item and tested
    #        for equality. This lets you use any method of {Item}, {Folder},
    #        and {File} as the criteria.
    # @return [Array] An array of all sub-items that matched the criteria.
    #
    # @note The recursive option will call {#tree}, which can be slow for
    #       large folders.
    # @note Any item method (as a symbol) can be used as criteria, which
    #       could cause major problems if used improperly.
    #
    # @example Find all sub-items with the name 'README'
    #   folder.search(:name => 'README')
    #
    # @example Recusively find a sub-item with the given path.
    #   folder.search(:path => '/test/file.mp4', :recursive => true)

    # @param [String] The path to search for. This follows the typical unix
    #                 path syntax, in that the root folder is '/'. Supports
    #                 the dot sytax, where '.' is the current folder and
    #                 '..' is the parent folder.
